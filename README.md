LEOKA: deals wiith the Leoka dataset where I calculate a few problems and make 2 descriptive bar plots.

NIBRS: deals with the NIBRS data (National Incident-Based Reporting System), where I create a lookup table for UCR offense codes, Find all crimes in Philadelphia for which the reporting agency was the Philadelphia Police
Department and make a table of the crime types, subset the property data to contain only mobile phones, figure out where the homicide rate is the highest.
